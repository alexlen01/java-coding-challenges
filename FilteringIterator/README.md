# _FilteringIterator_ - Coding Challenge

 Create an Iterator filtering framework: 
 * (1) IObjectTest interface with a single boolean test(Object o) method 
 * (2) an implementation of Iterator (let's call it FilteringIterator) which is initialized with another Iterator and an IObjectTest instance: new FilteringIterator(myIterator, myTest). 
 
 Your FilteringIterator will then allow iteration over 'myIterator', but skipping any objects which don't pass the 'myTest' test. 
 
 * Create a simple unit test for this framework.
